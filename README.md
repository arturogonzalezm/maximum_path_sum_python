# Triangle Path Sum Problem

## Description
Determine the maximum total from top to bottom of a given triangle, where at each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

## Input Format
- **First Line**: An integer `T`, representing the number of test cases.
- **Subsequent Lines**:
    - An integer `N`, denoting the number of rows in the triangle for each test case.
    - `N` lines follow, each containing integers separated by spaces, representing the triangle's rows.

## Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum path sum in a new line.

## Sample Input

```
   3
  7 4
 2 4 6
8 5 9 3
```

The maximum total is obtained by following the path 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> 9, producing a sum of 23.

## Sample Output

``` 
23
```

## Usage
Describe how to run the associated code and any commands needed to execute the test cases.
